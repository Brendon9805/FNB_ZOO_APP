    <h2>About the Gorilla</h2>
    <p>
      Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes that inhabit the forests of central Africa.
      The genus <em>Gorilla</em> is divided into two species: eastern and western gorillas, and several subspecies.
      They are the largest living primates by size and share 95–99% of their DNA with humans, making them our closest relatives after chimpanzees and bonobos.
    </p>
     <p>
      Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forests. Although their overall range is limited, they thrive across various elevations.
      Mountain gorillas live in montane cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes, between 2,200 to 4,300 meters in altitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lowland gorillas inhabit dense forests and swamps—western lowland gorillas are found in Central West Africa, while eastern lowland gorillas reside in the DRC near Rwanda.

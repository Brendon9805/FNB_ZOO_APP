    <h2>About the Lion</h2>
    <p>
      The lion (<em>Panthera leo</em>) is one of the five big cats in the genus Panthera and a member of the family Felidae.
      The term "African lion" generally refers to several subspecies found across Africa.
      Males can exceed 250 kg (550 lb), making lions the second-largest living cat after the tiger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India’s Gir Forest National Park. 
      Historically, they ranged across much of Africa, Europe, Asia, and even the Americas until about 10,000 years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, lions are classified as a vulnerable species. Populations have declined by 30–50% over recent decades, mainly due to habitat loss and human conflict.
      Lions outside protected reserves and parks face the highest risk, with West African lions being especially endangered.

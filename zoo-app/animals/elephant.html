    <h2>About Elephants</h2>
    <p>
      Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea.
      Two species are traditionally recognised: the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus).
      Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. 
      Male African elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb).
    </p>
    <p>
      All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis 
      used for breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, used as weapons and tools.
      African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.

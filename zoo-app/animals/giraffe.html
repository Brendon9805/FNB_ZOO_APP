    <h2>About the Giraffe</h2>
    <p>
      The giraffe (<em>Giraffa camelopardalis</em>) is an African even-toed ungulate mammal, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant.
      Its species name refers to its camel-like shape and its leopard-like colouring.
      Its chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. The nine subspecies are distinguished by their coat patterns.
      The giraffe's scattered range extends from Chad to South Africa, and from Niger to Somalia. They typically inhabit savannahs, grasslands, and open woodlands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their primary food source is acacia leaves, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach.
      Giraffes are preyed on by lions, while calves are at risk from leopards, hyenas, and wild dogs. 
      Adult giraffes form loose groups and males engage in "necking" battles to establish dominance for mating rights.

    <h4>Where Will You Find Them?</h4>
    <p>You will find the giraffes at <strong>G15</strong>, just beyond the research centre.</p>

    <h2>About the Koala</h2>
    <p>
      The koala (<em>Phascolarctos cinereus</em>, or inaccurately, koala bear) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia.
      It is the only living member of the family Phascolarctidae, with wombats being its closest relatives. 
      Found along the eastern and southern coasts of Australia, koalas are easily recognized by their stout bodies, fluffy ears, and spoon-shaped noses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adult koalas range from 60–85cm in length and weigh 4–15 kg. Their fur ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown, 
      with northern koalas being smaller and lighter. These populations may represent subspecies, though this is debated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Koalas live in eucalyptus forests and feed almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves. Due to their low-energy diet, 
      they sleep up to 20 hours a day. Koalas are solitary animals, except for mother-offspring pairs. Males communicate with deep bellows and mark territory with chest gland secretions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped joeys that live in their mothers’ pouches for 6–7 months. 
      Though they have few predators, koalas face threats from disease, habitat loss, bushfires, and drought.
